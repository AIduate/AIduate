- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AIduate
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, R, SQL, machine learning, statistics and insurance
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science

I come from an applied math bachelors program where I studied programming for my electives and discovered my love for analytics!
I went back to school for a data analytics graduate program, which I enjoyed very much and now currently apply my skills as a data analytics engineer.

I also continue my learning in my personal time with Udacity and would love to collaborate on the right project!
